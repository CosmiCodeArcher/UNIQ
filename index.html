            <h2>The 7-Herb Blend Is What You Need To Flush Out H.Pylori and Close Stomach Wounds In Weeks... Without Expensive Swallowing Daily Pills.</h2>

            <h2>How UNIQ Tea Actually Works</h2>
            <p><b>Why Your Regular Drugs Stopped Working</b></p>
            <p>You need to understand one thing: The drugs you buy at the pharmacy (Antacids) are designed to do <i>one</i> thing—reduce stomach acid. That is why the pain stops for a few hours.</p>
            <p><b>But Acid is not the enemy.</b> The enemy is the <b>WOUND (The Ulcer)</b> inside your stomach lining.</p>
            <p>Reducing the acid without healing the wound is like turning off the light so you don’t see a fire burning in your house.</p>
            <p><strong>The fire is still there!</strong></p>
            <img src="https://jewell.getbrahmishakti.xyz/supp/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SKMEI-IMG-1.jpg" alt="How It Works Image">
            <p>UNIQ Tea is different because it uses a <b>"Search and Seal"</b> technology derived from its unique 7-Herb blend. </p>
            <p><strong>Here is exactly what</strong> happens when you drink a cup:</p>
            <h4><b>STAGE 1: The "Cooling" Effect (Stops Bloating & Reflux Instantly)</b></h4>
            <p>The moment the warm tea hits your stomach, the <b>Ginger Roots</b> and <b>Wild Sage Leaves</b> go to work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Gas Valve:</b> If you suffer from bloating, it’s because gas is trapped. Ginger acts as a natural "carminative"—it relaxes the stomach muscles and forces the trapped gas out (you might burp a few times!).</li>
                <li><b>The Acid Block:</b> <b>Vervain Whole Plant</b> helps tighten the valve between your stomach and throat, stopping the acid from rising up and burning your chest (Reflux).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><b>STAGE 2: The "Bacteria Flush" (Attacks the Root Cause)</b></h4>
            <p>Most stubborn ulcers are kept alive by a bacteria called <i>H. Pylori</i>. As long as this bacteria is hiding in your stomach, the wound cannot heal.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Sweepers:</b> We used <b>Cassia Occidentalis</b> and <b>Terminalia Catappa Leaves</b> because they are powerful natural cleansers. They don't just sit there; they work to detoxify the gut environment, making it impossible for bad bacteria to survive and multiply.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><b>STAGE 3: The "Coat & Heal" (Closes the Wound)</b></h4>
            <p>This is the most important part. Once the gas is gone and the bacteria is suppressed, the <b>Cocylospermum Tinctorum Root</b> (a powerful traditional healer) works with <b>Verbena Officinalis</b>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Natural Bandage:</b> Think of this blend as a "liquid bandage." It forms a protective herbal mucilage (coating) over the raw, open sore in your stomach lining.</li>
                <li><b>Pain-Free Eating:</b> This coating protects the wound from food and acid, allowing your body to naturally repair the skin underneath. This is why our customers can go back to eating Pepper Soup and spicy foods after their treatment!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>WHO EXACTLY IS <span class="highlight">UNIQ</span> TEA FOR?</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">(And Will It Permanently End The Ulcer So It Doesn't Come Back?)</p>
            <img src="https://jewell.getbrahmishakti.xyz/supp/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/uniq-ingredients.jpg" alt="Ingredients">
            <p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong class="warning">"I have had ulcer for 10 years, can this small tea really help me?"</strong></em></p>
            <p>We get this question a lot:</p>
            <p>And the simple answer has always been <b>YES</b>.</p>
            <p>UNIQ Herbal Tea was not created for "mild stomach aches." It was formulated specifically for <b>severe, stubborn, and chronic cases</b> where regular hospital drugs have failed.</p>
            <p><b>If you fall into any of these 4 categories, this tea is PERFECT for you:</b></p>
            <h3><span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>1. The "Veteran" Ulcer Patient</b></span></h3>
            <p>You have been treating Gastric or Duodenal Ulcer for years. You have a "pharmacy" in your bag—Omeprazole, Gestid, Mist Mag. They give you relief for a few hours, but the pain <i>always</i> comes back.</p>
            <blockquote><p><b>Why UNIQ Works For You:</b> It doesn't just lower acid. It uses <b>Cocylospermum Root</b> to physically coat and heal the open wound that is causing the pain.</p></blockquote>
            <h3><span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>2. The "H. Pylori" Victim</b></span></h3>
            <p>You went to the lab, and the test said <b>"H. Pylori Positive."</b> You took the strong antibiotics (Kit), but the infection came back after a few months.</p>
            <blockquote><p><b>Why UNIQ Works For You:</b> The <b>Cassia Occidentalis</b> and <b>Terminalia Leaves</b> in this tea are natural cleansers. They flush out the bacteria hiding in your gut lining so the infection doesn't return.</p></blockquote>
            <h3><span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>3. The "Chest Fire" Sufferer (GERD/Reflux)</b></span></h3>
            <p>You don't just have stomach pain; you have a burning fire moving up your chest to your throat. You struggle to sleep at night because lying down makes it worse. You constantly feel like something is "stuck" in your throat.</p>
            <blockquote><p><b>Why UNIQ Works For You:</b> The <b>Wild Sage</b> and <b>Vervain</b> calm the esophageal valve, stopping the acid from rising up. You will sleep like a baby from the very first night.</p></blockquote>
            <h3><span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>4. The "Bloated" Belly</b></span></h3>
            <p>You feel heavy and full even when you haven't eaten much. Your stomach makes embarrassing noises, and you release gas frequently.</p>
            <blockquote><p><b>Why UNIQ Works For You:</b> <b>Ginger Roots</b> act immediately to break down trapped gas and stop the bloating in minutes.</p></blockquote>

                    <p>Almost Instantly for some symptoms. The bloating and "chest fire" usually calm down within the first 24 hours. However, the internal wound (the ulcer itself) needs time to close. That is why we recommend the <b>2-Month Pack</b> for a total cure.</p>

                    <p>It has a natural, earthy herbal taste. It is not sugary, but it is not "bitter leaf" either. It is very easy to drink. If you have a sweet tooth, you can add a little pure honey (but avoid white sugar!).</p>

                    <p><b>YES.</b> The goal of this tea is to heal your stomach lining so it becomes strong again. Once the wound is sealed, you can go back to enjoying your favorite spicy meals without fear.</p>

                    <p>It takes less than 15 minutes because you don't need to boil pots of herbs like "Agbo."</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Put <b>1 Teabag</b> into a cup of freshly boiled hot water.</li>
                        <li>Cover it and let it sit (steep) for <b>5-10 minutes</b>. <i>Don't rush this part—this is when the healing herbs are released into the water.</i></li>
                        <li>Drink it <b>warm</b> on an empty stomach (30 mins before breakfast). This coats your stomach lining for the day.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b class="warning">DOSAGE</b>: ONCE <b>Daily</b> (Morning is recommended) to see fast changes.</p>
                    <p><b class="warning">PRO TIP</b>: <em>Do not add milk! If you want it sweet, use a little pure honey. Milk can trigger more acid and reduce the effectiveness of the herbs.</em></p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Mukta', sans-serif; font-size: 24px; text-transform: uppercase; color: #000000;">"Does it have side effects? Will it make me feel weak or dizzy?"</h3>
                    <p><b>Absolutely not.</b> Unlike strong hospital antibiotics that can leave you feeling tired, nauseous, or "shaky," UNIQ Tea is <b>100% Natural</b>.</p>
                    <p>You can drink it and drive or go to work safely.</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ffcc00;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span>: <em>You may need to visit the bathroom a bit more frequently in the first 3-5 days. But this is <b>GOOD.</b> It means the herbs are flushing out the trapped gas and waste from your system.</em></p>
